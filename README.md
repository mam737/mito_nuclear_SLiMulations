# MITOCHONDRIAL - NUCLEAR INTERACTIONS IN SLiM3

This repository contains all of the SLiM scripts used to explore the consequence of disrupting co-evolved mitochondrial - nuclear interactions dependent on (1) the chromosomal placement of nuclear restorers for mitochondrial Mother's Curse variants and (2) the mode of migration. The following acronyms are used to refer to the modes of migration:

- CSM: Continuous Symmetric Migration
- PSM: 1 Gen of Symmetric Migration
- CAM: Continuous Asymmetric Migration
- CSSM: Continuous Sex-Specific Migration

We consider three locations for nuclear restorers: autosomal (auto), X-Linked, and Y-Linked.

We additionally considered 3 extensions of our model with continuous symmetric migration to test certain held assumptions. These extensions can be found in the folder for CSM. They encompass:
- VAD: Vary Autosomal Dominance (of nuclear restorers)
- DFF: Differential Female Fitness (for each mitochondrial haplogroup)
- EME: Extreme Male Effects (for Mother's Curse variants)

As these were tests, these models were only run for a subset of the parameter space explored.
