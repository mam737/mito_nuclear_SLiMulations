# MITOCHONDRIAL - NUCLEAR INTERACTIONS IN SLiM3

This repository contains all of the SLiM scripts used to explore the consequence of disrupting co-evolved mitochondrial - nuclear interactions dependent on (1) the chromosomal placement of nuclear restorers for mitochondrial Mother's Curse variants and (2) the mode of migration. The following acronyms are used to refer to the modes of migration:

- CSM: Continuous Symmetric Migration
- PSM: 1 Gen of Symmetric Migration
- CAM: Continuous Asymmetric Migration
- CSSM: Continuous Sex-Specific Migration

We consider three locations for nuclear restorers: autosomal (auto), X-Linked, and Y-Linked.
